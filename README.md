## Webscraping

scrape_linkedin_ppl.py is a python script that is used for scraping linkedin website contacts from the search results (not individual
linkedin pages). Almost all webscrape scripts are dependent on the structure and layout of the websites being scraped, so they need to be
updated if changes have been made to the website, otherwise script will not run.

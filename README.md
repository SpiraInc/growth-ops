This is a repository for holding all growth related activities in regards to Spira Inc. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get started

### Prerequisites
The following should be installed for the scripts to run in Python 3:
 - Selenium
 - Beautiful Soup 4
 - Pandas
 - Numpy
 - Urllib

Out of these, selenium is the most time consuming (for me, at least). Seek help from the Internets if you run into trouble.

### Webscraping

```scrape_linkedin_ppl.py``` is a python script that is used for scraping linkedin website contacts from the search results (not individual linkedin pages). Almost all webscrape scripts are dependent on the structure and layout of the websites being scraped, so they need to be updated if changes have been made to the website, otherwise script will not run.
